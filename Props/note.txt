React Components and Props
--------------------------
React components are the building blocks of any React application. They come in two flavors: function components 
and class components. Function components are simpler and more suited for components that do not require state 
management or lifecycle methods. On the other hand, class components offer more features but are slightly more 
complex.

Props, short for properties, are the mechanism by which React components communicate with each other. They are 
read-only and allow the passing of data from parent components to child components. Props can include simple data 
like strings and numbers, but they can also include functions and even other components.
